        question: "Why is this platform for the students aged 10 to 15?",
        answer: "10 to 15 is a typical age for the formation of oneâ€™s world view. If we succeed in helping pre-teens and teens in this age group to gain awareness about sustainable development, they will carry the mindset to their later life phases."

        question: "Why project based learning (PBL)?",
        answer: "Project based learning is different from the traditional classroom teaching, students stay in the frontend, that means they will define the project goals to solve the given challenges. They will work on their own paces to gain knowledge needed. Teachers will be turned to mentors, staying on the side to offer necessary support. Project based learning, can help to improve the abilities of communication, collaboration, critical thinking and self-learning."

        question: "Are the projects you give under extracurricular or intra curricular activities for students?",
        answer: "Currently our projects will be offered as extra curricular courses. Quokkonnect does not want to add extra burden to its participants. In the future, we plan on integrating our platform with local schools and recognize the learning effort of the students as intra curricular projects."

        question: "Are all the programs online?",
        answer: "For now, Yes. However later on we plan to offer a hybrid learning model depending on distance among participants. For example, individual research can be done at home and online. Teambuilding, interviews, practice and other in-person activities will be conducted offline, if possible. We believe face to face interaction is always best!"

        question: "What about the language barriers amongst students?",
        answer: "Participants are totally free in choosing their most comfortable language. We would team up the participants based on the language preferences.

However if you want to team up with students from your region you can choose a regional language."
