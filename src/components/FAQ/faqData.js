        question:"Why 10 to 15?",
        answer:"Kids under 10 should be freed from too much formal learning contents. Kids above 15 will be having other learning targets for senior school or even college/universities afterwards. 10 to 15 is a typical age for the formation of oneâ€™s world view. If we succeed in helping pre-teens and teens in this age group to gain awareness about sustainable development, they will carry the mindset to their later life phases."

        question:"Why project based learning (PBL)?",
        answer:"Different from the traditional classroom teaching, participants in project based learning stay in the frontend. That means, they will define the project goals to solve the given challenges. They will work on their own paces to gain knowledge needed. Teachers will be turned to mentors, staying on the side to offer necessary support. Project based learning, if applied properly, can help to improve the abilities of communication, collaboration, critical thinking and self-learning."
